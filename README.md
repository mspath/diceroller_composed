# Dice Roller Composed

A hello world style app which lets you check your setup and roll a dice.

This is the second app of the [Android Basics with Compose] course from Google, see [Unit 2] [Pathway 2] and the [Create an interactive Dice Roller app] Codelab.

(it basically is the 'composed' cousin of the Dice Roller app from Google's Android Basics with Kotlin Course)
